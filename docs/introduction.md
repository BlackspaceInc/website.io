Blackspace Platform provides an environment through which commerce between consumers and minority owned business can be facilitated.

## Why Blackspace

Amazon does not do enough to empower minority owned businesses as well as enable the discovery of such businesses.

There are a lot of "logistics" to get right as we work on bringing our solution to light:

* How to incentivize businesses to onboard on blackspace?
* What ways can we better empower businesses?
* How to elevate the quality of social interactions on our platform?
* How can we transform our ecommerce solution to better fit various use cases?

> Blackspace aims to be the complete ecommerce solution of the future.

Our main priorities are the following:

* __Provide a marketplace__: allow people to not only discover minority owned businesses but also buy from them.
* __Empower businesses__: provide businesses with a suite of product offerings to better drive traffic and growth.
* __Analytics driven shopping experience__: enable businesses and platform users to better tailor their content to elevate engagement.
